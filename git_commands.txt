1. You can push with using different account. 
	For example, if your account is **A** which is stored in .gitconfig and you want to use account **B** which is the owner of the repo you want to push.

	Account **B**: B_user_name, B_password<br>
	Example of SSH link: https://github.com/B_user_name/project.git

	The push with **B** account is:

		$ git push https://'B_user_name':'B_password'@github.com/B_user_name/project.git

	To see the account in .gitconfig

	1. `$git config --global --list`
	2. `$git config --global -e`  (to change account also)

2. Although, previous solution will keep you pushing as yourself, but it will allow you to push into her repo. 
	If you don't want this and work in different folder on the same pc, 
	you can setup username and email locally inside a folder with git by removing -g flag of the config command:

	git config user.name her_username
	git config user.email her_email
